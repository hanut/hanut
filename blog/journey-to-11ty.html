            <p>
                Let's face it, I have been putting off setting up my blog and website for the longest time. 
                I never really did much with the gaudy looking monster I created the first time anyway. 
                So you really can't blame me for not giving it a second thought.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, I started giving serious thought to redoing my website somewhere in the 
                beginning of 2020 and had my sights firmly set on Gatsby as my go-to for building my spiffy 
                new profile. Fast forward a few months and I was nowhere close to having anything worth 
                uploading (No fault of the tool mind you. Gatsby is great!).
            </p>

            <p>
                With tons of work on my plate managing several key projects for some top-tier clients and 
                little to no free time, it was only natural that the whole thing just sat in my Github repo 
                for another 7 months before I finally had the courage to look at it again.
            </p>

            <p>
                During this time though, I did get my hands dirty with Hugo, a wonderful SSG built on Go. 
                The ease and flexibility was a breath of fresh air and I was almost certainly going to build 
                <a href="https://hanutsingh.in">this site</a> with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I sat down to bootstrap my project, I ended up reading a bunch of articles on SSGs as 
                you often do and <em>BAM</em> - @11ty/eleventy stuck out of the pile. I was skeptical at 
                first, but given I wanted to get up and running as soon as possible (given my prior history 
                of putting this off, every minute was precious 😂). So I fired up the ol' VS Code and after 
                a tiny setup and couple of lines of <em>CSS</em> + some <em>.njk</em> files the whole damn 
                thing was ready!
            </p>

            <p>
                And that my dears is how I finally managed to get my website back online after a 3-year 
                hiatus - with some ❤️ @11ty.
