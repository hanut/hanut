# Hi, I'm **Hanut**

### **Human In The Loop • Solutions Architect • Problem Solver • Entrepreneur • Technologist**

I build scalable systems, lead high‑performing engineering teams, and design cloud‑native architectures that turn ideas into real, measurable impact. With 13+ years across startups and enterprises, I thrive at the intersection of **technology, product strategy, and execution**.

I’m obsessed with:
- ⚡ High‑leverage engineering  
- ☁️ Cloud architecture & distributed systems  
- 🤖 AI‑augmented workflows  
- 🚀 Building products end‑to‑end  
- 🌍 Travel, learning, and continuous reinvention  

Lately, I’ve been deep into **AI‑enhanced development workflows**, exploring how LLMs and agentic systems reshape engineering velocity and creativity.
